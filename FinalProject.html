            <p class="text-center">Baseball</p> <br> I started playing baseball when I was in Kindergarten. Ever since, I have honed my skills to become one of the best players in the world. I've gotten many awards through baseball including MVP, best offensive player, and I've even made it onto the 1st League team. Baseball is fun because you make lots of friends that you can rely on. <br> <br> "It's fun; baseball is fun." - Yogi Berra

            <p class="text-center">Cello</p> <br> The cello is an instrument with a beautiful sound. Ever since I started playing the cello, I knew that I could rely on it to help me relax. I've played at Carnegie Halls and in multiple orchestras, but playing alone gives me the most peace. My favorite thing about the cello is the fact that one requires skill coordinating their two hands to do two different things at the same time. <br> <br> "Practice does not make perfect.

            <p class="text-center">Hobbies</p> <br> Something that I like to do in my free time is play games. One game that I enjoy more than others is League of Legends. League of Legends is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game created by Riot Games in 2009. I enjoy playing this game because it requires not only skill, but also teamwork and luck. My goal in this game is to someday become the rank 1 player. <br> <br> "Honor is in the heart, not in the name." - Yasuo

            <p class="text-center">Travel</p> <br> I've been to many places in the US and outside. My all time favorite is Alaska, due to its King Crabs and Northern lights. Other places that I've been to include Canada, China, Italy, France, and England. My favorite part of traveling is being able to see and experience the many different things the world has to provide. <br> <br> "A change of latitude would help my attitude." – Unknown
